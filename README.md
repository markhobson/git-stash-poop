# Git Stash Poop ðŸ’©

Ever tried to pop a git stash and made an amusing typo? Now you can make it even more rewarding.

## Installation

Install by running:

    cat alias >> ~/.bash_aliases

Open a new terminal (or type `source ~/.bash_aliases`) and try it using:

    git stash poop

## Building

To rebuild the alias from the source image:

    ./build.sh
